PgZVTC_76_0,0,15,My SO snored so loud one night that it scared me out of my sleep.
PgZVTC_76_1,0,17,Having a snoring roommate or SO can be very infuriating due to your lack of sleep now.
PgZVTC_80_2,0,8,It drowns him out and I can sleep.
PgZVTC_80_3,0,10,Try that :/ hopefully a solution comes your way soon.
PgZVTC_86_2,0,10,"Except, it was a group of boys talking behind me."
PgZVTC_86_3,0,11,I couldn't concentrate or pay attention to my professor at all.
PgZVTC_86_4,0,21,"So I got up in the middle of class and blatantly moved all my things to the front, away from them."
PgZVTC_87_3,0,21,My best friend told me that everything happens for a reason though.. And things do and will get better with time.
PgZVTC_87_4,0,3,Hang in there.
PgZVTC_88_3,0,21,My best friend told me that everything happens for a reason though.. And things do and will get better with time.
PgZVTC_88_4,0,3,Hang in there.
PgZVTC_95_1,0,6,Ditto... Makes me sad too. :/
PgZVTC_95_2,0,11,some people just have to learn the hard way I guess.
PgZVTC_102_5,0,4,I felt so stupid.
PgZVTC_117_1,0,11,She definitely must have some self esteem issues of her own.
PgZVTC_161_0,0,2,Fingers crossed!!
PgZVTC_164_2,0,8,Cross that bish  off when I finish it.
PgZVTC_171_1,0,19,Something to do with thinking you have enough time to do many things before you have to be somewhere.
PgZVTC_172_5,0,7,"You shouldn't feel guilty, because I don't."
PgZVTC_194_0,0,2,LOL literally!
PgZVTC_202_5,0,14,I miss her all the time and can't talk about her without getting emotional.
PgZVTC_202_6,0,19,The pain never goes away but you just learn to accept it and deal with it.. you'll get there.
PgZVTC_212_0,0,4,I can't stop crying.
PgZVTC_212_1,0,4,It's been several hours.
PgZVTC_214_1,0,11,This is one of the hardest decisions that I've ever made.
PgZVTC_214_2,0,17,I've never felt pain like this in my entire life and hope I never do after this.
PgZVTC_214_7,0,18,"But until that day comes, we just have to focus on taking it one day at a time."
PgZVTC_243_6,0,5,"I, however, was instantly irritated."
mR9stN_29_0,0,9,I think I'm gonna go with the first one.
mR9stN_29_1,0,6,I'm very confident in my decision.
mR9stN_85_0,0,12,So I guess I have about 18 weeks to look forward to!
mR9stN_88_26,0,21,"I'm still genuinely upset about it, but my thankfully rationality is telling my heart to shut it for the time being."
mR9stN_96_1,0,1,Seriously.
mR9stN_96_2,0,4,I cried over TWITTER.
mR9stN_96_3,0,28,"I'm not much of a crier in the first place, so when the tears hit me because of a stupid social media non-issue, I just let 'em come."
mR9stN_121_0,0,13,I know I should enjoy every second but I cannot WAIT for hiccups!
mR9stN_123_2,0,6,Maybe this IS a good thing!
mR9stN_138_0,0,14,"I'm 20, close to graduating college and knocked up, so I feel you, sister."
mR9stN_138_1,0,7,This thread has just made me sad.
mR9stN_140_3,0,9,And that makes me feel like a real jerk.
mR9stN_142_5,0,5,It happened twice this week!
mR9stN_168_6,0,6,Why have I been depriving myself.
mR9stN_168_7,0,11,I thought that I could manage without them but never again.
mR9stN_168_13,0,1,Seriously.
mR9stN_168_22,0,4,My mood is high!
mR9stN_168_23,0,19,I just have to get through finals this week and I'll have the whole summer to gestate and work.
mR9stN_180_0,0,16,"Excuse my bathroom, but here's to the start of the third trimester - my 27th week!"
mR9stN_180_1,0,30,"Starting to feel constantly sleepy again, but I pinched myself awake for my little brother's graduation and even managed to make the 4-hour car ride with only one potty break!"
mR9stN_180_2,0,1,http://i.imgur.com/9hiPTj8.jpg
mR9stN_190_0,0,18,"I'm 29 weeks along with my first, a girl, and I am so detached that I'm worried, too."
mR9stN_190_2,0,24,"It's not that I don't want her; I do, I'm just not quite up to calling her by her name or talking to her."
mR9stN_191_2,0,15,I feel like I've been pregnant forever - does anyone else know what I mean?
mR9stN_194_0,0,2,29 weeeeeks!
mR9stN_194_1,0,22,"I keep feeling like I have so much time still, but as soon as I hit 30, I think reality will hit."
mR9stN_200_14,0,19,TL;DR - I cry sometimes because I irrationally think my boyfriend loves Battlefield more than the baby and me.
mR9stN_202_0,0,8,That's the exact thread that brought me here!!
mR9stN_202_2,0,21,"But yes, I do try to keep it in check, because I don't want something so petty to cause a rift."
mR9stN_208_2,0,7,I feel much better about it now!
mR9stN_214_0,0,19,"I used to be really, really insecure, and would constantly do immature things like rely on guys for validation."
mR9stN_214_1,0,15,"I placed so much value on another person being interested in me, it was pitiful."
mR9stN_214_2,0,16,I have no doubt that this all stems from my very poor relationship with my dad.
mR9stN_214_3,0,25,"Now, however, it's like this baby has brought me a sense of calm and purpose - being seen as desirable is no longer my priority."
mR9stN_214_4,0,24,"Instead, I want to be the absolute best role model I can be, the kind of woman my daughter will be very proud of."
mR9stN_214_6,0,14,"It's strange because the insecurities are still there, they just don't mean as much."
mR9stN_220_0,0,47,"About last week (29 weeks) when I dropped a bunch of stuff on the floor and then just stared at it sadly, knowing that there was no way in hell I was gonna exert the energy to pick it up because nothing was that important right now."
mR9stN_220_1,0,9,Think of Gob's face as 'Sound of Silence' plays.
mR9stN_220_2,0,22,... For the record I left it there and instead took a nap on the couch about a foot away from it.
mR9stN_238_0,0,55,"I constantly have food dreams like this, but in all of them I'll be surrounded by delicious food but won't eat any because I don't want to gain over my target weight - and then I wake up and am SO PISSED cuz even in my dreams I can't eat piles and piles of Starbursts."
mR9stN_250_2,0,7,It's getting to the tearful fights point.
mR9stN_252_0,0,18,I can't even imagine the stress at 37 weeks... And I thought not knowing at 32 was bad!
mR9stN_259_0,0,3,I have nothing.
mR9stN_259_1,0,9,This pregnancy has just underscored my uselessness it seems!
mR9stN_261_1,0,6,This is my most recent struggle.
mR9stN_261_2,0,14,That and the loss of the ability to put socks/shoes on while standing up.
mR9stN_281_6,0,3,So I left.
mR9stN_284_0,0,3,I'm 34 weeks.
mR9stN_284_1,0,21,I measure the hours in a day between 'eating' and 'occupying my time until it is socially acceptable to eat again.'
mR9stN_284_2,0,19,"I rarely make it, I have to feed every 2 hours or else I feel like I am starving."
mR9stN_285_2,0,7,I would be in tears every day.
mR9stN_290_6,0,8,I know how vulnerable I've felt this pregnancy.
mR9stN_297_2,0,9,... See how well I can rationalize my procrastination??
mR9stN_299_0,0,3,My thoughts exactly!
mR9stN_299_1,0,12,"I figure if I prepare for the worst, I can't be disappointed."
mR9stN_307_5,0,18,Thank goodness I have you ladies to hang out with for the next month and some change (:
mR9stN_309_5,0,18,"Her daddy is fantastic, our parents are fantastic and our extended families are for the most part wonderful."
mR9stN_318_0,0,14,"36 weeks today and constantly exhausted and achey, so just the standard complaints here."
mR9stN_324_4,0,4,Am I horrible? ...
mR9stN_324_5,0,3,Maybe a little!
mR9stN_329_3,0,15,"There is seriously so much pressure, no one told me it would be like this!"
mR9stN_333_0,0,16,I can't have any other outlets for my sexuality whatsoever but he can look at porn.
mR9stN_333_1,0,12,"... It's minor and I love him to death, but it's frustrating."
mR9stN_333_2,0,5,Not worth bringing up though.
mR9stN_336_1,0,1,Seriously.
mR9stN_341_1,0,3,How're you feeling?
mR9stN_341_3,0,18,I can stress about how to reduce cellulite once I have safely brought this baby into the world!
mR9stN_343_4,0,14,I have a feeling people will forget thanks to all of the baby stuff.
mR9stN_360_3,0,27,"I had never had acid reflux before, so this was all new torture to me, and then my doc told me 30 mg of Prevacid a day."
mR9stN_366_0,0,18,"Haha I'm glad you think so, I'm starting to feel a tiny bit guilty for being so snappy."
mR9stN_366_1,0,7,"And I agree - PLEASE hurry, fall!"
mR9stN_374_3,0,22,"I don't like being patronized, but I appreciate kind gestures and accept the fact that I am physically less capable right now."
mR9stN_378_0,0,9,I don't think anyone can blame you for that.
mR9stN_398_0,0,26,I'm six days away from my due date and other than going to class have no plans but to sit and sulk until this baby comes.
mR9stN_398_1,0,21,"Oh and walk and coax my SO into sex, that too, because even if it doesn't work, what's it gonna hurt?"
mR9stN_407_5,0,11,After that everything hurts and nothing is going to get done.
mR9stN_423_33,0,34,"I stuck with it and things definitely improved, now my milk is in and my boobs are massive and heavy and sore but Luce is eating like a champ and pooping just as well!"
mR9stN_436_0,0,9,Haha I don't know firsthand but I can imagine!
mR9stN_437_0,0,2,"Yes, this!"
mR9stN_437_1,0,32,"The night before I'd only had 4 hours of sleep and I know if I hadn't slept during labor thanks to the epidural, pushing would have lasted much longer than 30 minutes."
mR9stN_444_0,0,4,I am literally crying.
mR9stN_457_25,0,21,"I was incredibly vain prepregnancy and panicked when I found out I was pregnant, thinking that this would be the end."
mR9stN_462_3,0,13,"So I guess between 30-35 pounds, depending on how you look at it."
mR9stN_492_3,0,9,"But by 'non-violent' that excludes sexual crimes too, right?"
mR9stN_493_0,0,3,It lasts forever!!!
mR9stN_493_1,0,4,I am in love.
mR9stN_508_3,0,17,Yours was just the encouragement I needed (: people like you is why I LOVE this sub!
mR9stN_511_3,0,15,Instead they've either forgotten about it or are laughing at you for being a sap.
mR9stN_555_1,0,18,"Elaborate, use your big boy words; 'disrespecting' is not enough of a reason to get violent or loud."
mR9stN_559_0,0,6,This made me happy AND sad.
mR9stN_591_4,0,8,And how far along are you with planning?
mR9stN_591_5,0,3,Validate my procrastination!
mR9stN_598_6,0,18,I'm just waiting for the ruder girls to grow up and then maybe we can all be nice.
mR9stN_626_1,0,9,Why did I think I was alone in this?!
mR9stN_626_2,0,14,"Any father-daughter scene where there is some sweetness, I cry like a little bitch."
mR9stN_626_14,0,6,Sorry for this tome of text.
mR9stN_639_1,0,17,"I'm just feeling so incredibly lost right now, which I'm sure is common for most recent graduates."
mR9stN_639_2,0,42,I think I just feel like I have to keep it together because I have a whole new person relying on me when really I just want to freak out and panic because the future is so uncertain and giant and scary.
mR9stN_639_3,0,14,Edited to add thank you for taking the time out to comment with that.
mR9stN_640_0,0,13,"Oh no, definitely just learn how to balance my life and priorities better."
mR9stN_640_1,0,5,I couldn't give her up.
mR9stN_661_2,0,30,"I don't feel the need to call myself anything sexuality-wise, but if I did, it wouldn't be a lesbian, because I am marrying (and thereby attracted to sexually) a man."
mR9stN_661_3,0,5,So that would be invalid.
mR9stN_671_5,0,9,My life is better because she is in it.
mR9stN_686_3,0,3,The secret revealed.
mR9stN_720_2,0,14,"I'm glad I posted, though, so I can compare my thoughts now and then!"
mR9stN_721_1,0,9,And such a good way to look at it.
mR9stN_724_1,0,26,"I'm getting married in 28 days and it is so cool to hear that you did experience a sort of deeper, positive shift in the dynamic."
mR9stN_774_2,0,7,I'm so happy that I'm not alone.
mR9stN_798_0,0,7,I have the same frustration you have.
mR9stN_874_5,0,23,"Or else you'd be me, married and panicked and lying awake at midnight surreptitiously browsing AL because you know something is just wrong."
mR9stN_890_2,0,12,"I know I'm ambisextrous, the world can think I'm straight, who cares."
Ju28Kt_3_0,0,7,They are all a bunch of pussies.
Ju28Kt_256_6,0,6,We blame the screwed up individual.
Ju28Kt_256_7,0,7,So why blame guns in gun death?
Ju28Kt_342_1,0,5,I dipped for 35 years.
Ju28Kt_342_2,0,10,Quitting is the best thing I ever did for myself.
Ju28Kt_615_0,0,5,Now ur making me hungry.
Ju28Kt_631_2,0,9,And it wouldn't be the first or last time.
Ju28Kt_633_0,0,11,I suppose the parents should not be held responsible in anyway?
Ju28Kt_820_2,0,5,No consequences ever for Finn
d451im_47_0,0,13,Your overuse of exclamation points and inability to spell indictment have swayed me.
eUfCgh_93_0,0,6,I see what I can do.
eUfCgh_135_0,0,2,I understand.
eUfCgh_174_2,0,11,I never really liked the servers with existing structures and spawncity.
eUfCgh_174_3,0,17,I always loved a fresh start and as soon as I lose interest I just never join.
eUfCgh_174_4,0,9,Minecraft is just not what it used to be.
eUfCgh_184_0,0,13,We can all sit down and talk about ways to fix this problem.
eUfCgh_184_1,0,18,The sad thing is it will never get fixed and we will always have our retards in ranked.
eUfCgh_276_0,0,5,I cried a lil.... Rip
eUfCgh_281_0,0,6,A dildo cuz I don't care.
eUfCgh_305_2,0,6,Works all the time for me.
eUfCgh_369_1,0,5,But no for real congratz.
eUfCgh_386_1,0,5,Now I feel like shit.

gDM6x8_588_3,0,32,"For years i would wake up as late as possible to when i had to, if i didn't have to wake up (like on the weekend) i would just sleep all day."
gDM6x8_644_2,0,56,"I've never slept like this before either, I actual get tired at night and i dont even use an alarm clock to wake up... I'm 40... that's never been a thing for me, since i can remember midday was my wake up time (if not later) and getting up prior to this was a massive ask."
gDM6x8_786_0,0,6,Made a total dick of myself.

fSrPWk_1988_8,0,4,This is not sad.
fSrPWk_2089_0,0,22,&gt; My mind is focused on so many different things and I really have a lot of work stuff to focus on.
fSrPWk_3339_2,0,7,It's just something that irritates me sometimes.
fSrPWk_4560_4,0,25,It's improved my confidence and now I look in the mirror and admire the K-glow instead of focusing on superficial flaws like I used to.
fY0siO_223_1,0,11,"They don't have to be interested in everything, or really anything."
R8WG9s_3_17,0,18,"On top of that, any punishment my brother received for his bad behavior often carried over to me."

R8WG9s_542_1,1,16,I just stopped caring about a lot of things and got bored with life in general.
R8WG9s_542_2,1,9,I had nothing to look forward to every day.
