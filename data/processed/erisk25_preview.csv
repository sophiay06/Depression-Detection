PgZVTC_76_1,My SO snored so loud one night that it scared me out of my sleep.,0,17,Having a snoring roommate or SO can be very infuriating due to your lack of sleep now.
PgZVTC_80_2,My solution was an extremely loud fan that I put right next to my head on a nightstand when I sleep.,0,8,It drowns him out and I can sleep.

PgZVTC_164_2,"Make a list of of the most important things to accomplish, and write the due date next to it.",0,8,Cross that bish  off when I finish it.
PgZVTC_171_1,I read somewhere that people who are always late tend to be more optimistic than people who are always on time.,0,19,Something to do with thinking you have enough time to do many things before you have to be somewhere.

mR9stN_123_2,"And awesome, that calms me down a bit.",0,6,Maybe this IS a good thing!
mR9stN_138_1,"I'm 20, close to graduating college and knocked up, so I feel you, sister.",0,7,This thread has just made me sad.
mR9stN_140_3,I'm gonna react negatively in that instant.,0,9,And that makes me feel like a real jerk.

mR9stN_190_2,"She wasn't planned, and I'm youngish (20), so I constantly wonder if I'm failing somehow and I'm just not 'motherly'.",0,24,"It's not that I don't want her; I do, I'm just not quite up to calling her by her name or talking to her."
mR9stN_191_2,8 hours of uninterrupted sleep is a hilarious concept thanks to frequent potty breaks and awful acid reflux.,0,15,I feel like I've been pregnant forever - does anyone else know what I mean?
mR9stN_194_1,29 weeeeeks!,0,22,"I keep feeling like I have so much time still, but as soon as I hit 30, I think reality will hit."
mR9stN_200_14,Am I crazy and hormonal or is this maybe a little bit normal?,0,19,TL;DR - I cry sometimes because I irrationally think my boyfriend loves Battlefield more than the baby and me.
mR9stN_202_2,"I thought to myself, 'oh God... I'm an annoying girlfriend!'",0,21,"But yes, I do try to keep it in check, because I don't want something so petty to cause a rift."
mR9stN_208_2,"But more so I'm glad you said that you cried when your SO went to work - to this day, I have maintained my own cry sessions after my boyfriend leaves for work as my most embarrassing pregnancy secret.",0,7,I feel much better about it now!
mR9stN_214_1,"I used to be really, really insecure, and would constantly do immature things like rely on guys for validation.",0,15,"I placed so much value on another person being interested in me, it was pitiful."
mR9stN_214_2,"I placed so much value on another person being interested in me, it was pitiful.",0,16,I have no doubt that this all stems from my very poor relationship with my dad.

mR9stN_214_4,"Now, however, it's like this baby has brought me a sense of calm and purpose - being seen as desirable is no longer my priority.",0,24,"Instead, I want to be the absolute best role model I can be, the kind of woman my daughter will be very proud of."
mR9stN_214_6,"I made almost straight A's last semester, have been saving my money, and carry myself with real respect instead of heaps of bravada.",0,14,"It's strange because the insecurities are still there, they just don't mean as much."
mR9stN_220_1,"About last week (29 weeks) when I dropped a bunch of stuff on the floor and then just stared at it sadly, knowing that there was no way in hell I was gonna exert the energy to pick it up because nothing was that important right now.",0,9,Think of Gob's face as 'Sound of Silence' plays.
mR9stN_220_2,Think of Gob's face as 'Sound of Silence' plays.,0,22,... For the record I left it there and instead took a nap on the couch about a foot away from it.
mR9stN_250_2,Our biggest problem is that we can't agree on anything at all.,0,7,It's getting to the tearful fights point.

mR9stN_309_5,"Seriously, I cannot make any choices that seem to please everyone, but to be honest I do not care.",0,18,"Her daddy is fantastic, our parents are fantastic and our extended families are for the most part wonderful."
mR9stN_324_4,I'm just not ready to give that up yet!,0,4,Am I horrible? ...
mR9stN_324_5,Am I horrible? ...,0,3,Maybe a little!
mR9stN_329_3,Hard.,0,15,"There is seriously so much pressure, no one told me it would be like this!"
mR9stN_333_1,I can't have any other outlets for my sexuality whatsoever but he can look at porn.,0,12,"... It's minor and I love him to death, but it's frustrating."
mR9stN_333_2,"... It's minor and I love him to death, but it's frustrating.",0,5,Not worth bringing up though.

mR9stN_341_1,Hey due date buddy!!,0,3,How're you feeling?
mR9stN_341_3,And I'm inclined to do the same - just getting out of bed and doing regular chores and errands during the day leaves me exhausted.,0,18,I can stress about how to reduce cellulite once I have safely brought this baby into the world!
mR9stN_343_4,"Now, nothing.",0,14,I have a feeling people will forget thanks to all of the baby stuff.

mR9stN_366_1,"Haha I'm glad you think so, I'm starting to feel a tiny bit guilty for being so snappy.",0,7,"And I agree - PLEASE hurry, fall!"
mR9stN_374_3,"Personally, I appreciate when people are sympathetic to my discomfort and severely reduced mobility because everything IS more difficult and more painful.",0,22,"I don't like being patronized, but I appreciate kind gestures and accept the fact that I am physically less capable right now."
mR9stN_398_1,I'm six days away from my due date and other than going to class have no plans but to sit and sulk until this baby comes.,0,21,"Oh and walk and coax my SO into sex, that too, because even if it doesn't work, what's it gonna hurt?"
mR9stN_407_5,I usually have a window of 3 hours after I wake up where I feel normal.,0,11,After that everything hurts and nothing is going to get done.
mR9stN_423_33,"It got me down the second day in the hospital and I broke down in tears, feeling like a failure because I wanted to feed my baby but I dreaded doing it and I worried she could 'sense' my hatred of it.",0,34,"I stuck with it and things definitely improved, now my milk is in and my boobs are massive and heavy and sore but Luce is eating like a champ and pooping just as well!"
mR9stN_437_1,"Yes, this!",0,32,"The night before I'd only had 4 hours of sleep and I know if I hadn't slept during labor thanks to the epidural, pushing would have lasted much longer than 30 minutes."
mR9stN_457_25,"Again, all of these things don't matter so much.",0,21,"I was incredibly vain prepregnancy and panicked when I found out I was pregnant, thinking that this would be the end."
mR9stN_462_3,"Dropped down to 121, then steadily gained up to 155.",0,13,"So I guess between 30-35 pounds, depending on how you look at it."

mR9stN_511_3,I am now rethinking my actions and motives.',0,15,Instead they've either forgotten about it or are laughing at you for being a sap.
mR9stN_555_1,Anyone who uses 'he/she disrespected me' as a reason for getting upset or flying off the handle.,0,18,"Elaborate, use your big boy words; 'disrespecting' is not enough of a reason to get violent or loud."
mR9stN_591_4,What about you?,0,8,And how far along are you with planning?
mR9stN_591_5,And how far along are you with planning?,0,3,Validate my procrastination!

mR9stN_639_1,I think you really hit it when you said 'what do you want?',0,17,"I'm just feeling so incredibly lost right now, which I'm sure is common for most recent graduates."
mR9stN_639_2,"I'm just feeling so incredibly lost right now, which I'm sure is common for most recent graduates.",0,42,I think I just feel like I have to keep it together because I have a whole new person relying on me when really I just want to freak out and panic because the future is so uncertain and giant and scary.

mR9stN_661_2,I'm a woman who loves women and also loves men and I'm marrying a man.,0,30,"I don't feel the need to call myself anything sexuality-wise, but if I did, it wouldn't be a lesbian, because I am marrying (and thereby attracted to sexually) a man."
mR9stN_661_3,"I don't feel the need to call myself anything sexuality-wise, but if I did, it wouldn't be a lesbian, because I am marrying (and thereby attracted to sexually) a man.",0,5,So that would be invalid.

mR9stN_724_1,CONGRATULATIONS!!,0,26,"I'm getting married in 28 days and it is so cool to hear that you did experience a sort of deeper, positive shift in the dynamic."
mR9stN_774_2,I totally do this.,0,7,I'm so happy that I'm not alone.
mR9stN_874_5,"I haven't made a decision either way and it's fucking terrifying and I am so, so impressed by the strength and selflessness you took in being up front with your boy and being true to you.",0,23,"Or else you'd be me, married and panicked and lying awake at midnight surreptitiously browsing AL because you know something is just wrong."
mR9stN_890_2,I just don't even bother.,0,12,"I know I'm ambisextrous, the world can think I'm straight, who cares."
